## INTRO


![ref](../assets/img/ref1.png "ref")
The initial concept was to build a radar station located in the Arctic Circle, used as a Soviet-era Arctic Ocean monitoring base.

Rough storyboard brainstorming.

## DIVE INTO THE COLDNESS

After a mostly idle winter break, I decided to abandon the original idea due to the difficulty of creating a large-scale building from scratch. I switched to designing a smaller radar monitoring station, located in a northern Arctic city.

## BUILD IT

Started creating a large number of assets, using various Blender “black magic” tricks, including using node-based building generators like Buildify...
